# Prework Study Guide

## Description

My motivation for this project was to familiarize myself with coding, specifically get more practice wit Javascript before my coding bootcamp begins. This project was built to hold my notes for the various lessons I went through while completing my prework. This project solves the problem of having my notes scattered throughout different pages. I already am familiar with HTML, CSS, and the GIT work flow. I am familar with the syntax of Javascript but I am not as proficient with it compared to HTML and CSS so this was good practice learning more about for loops and functions.
